                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is

                be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on
                social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power
                to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must
                for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a
                lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible.We need to
                completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill
                set should be on the key agenda list…</p>

            <p class="section-subTag text-small">Focussing on the experiences and perceptions of parents and volunteer
                caregivers of children with disabilities, this paper reports on a study that explored the provision of
                early childhood development and inclusive education for children with disabilities in rural Malawi.
                Drawing on a community-based participatory research (CBPR) design, ten local community researchers and
                two Malawian researchers collaborated to interview forty caregivers and parents of children with
                disabilities attending ten Community Based Care Centres (CBCCS) in Southern Malawi. Findings are
                reported through four key themes: experiences of disability, inclusion, learning and developmental
                progress; factors influencing non-enrolment and absenteeism; barriers to learning and progress; and
                accountability and support channels.</p>
